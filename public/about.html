<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a former producer who has decided to take on the journey of learning programming, and web development is an attractive first step.</p>

<p>If you would like, I'm more than happy to take you through some of my previous proffessional experience and explain how I've 'landed' here. Make sure to visit the contact page to find out how to get in touch.</p>

<p>I would like to make sure that I learn enough to be able to generate web pages easily wherever needed.</p>
